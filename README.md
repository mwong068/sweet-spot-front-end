Sweet Spot is a marketplace for pastry chefs and small bakeries and restaurants to share their baked goods with their community. It was made to bring communities together and to highlight smaller businesses.

This was my final project at Flatiron School and is a combination of Rails, React, Redux, Thunk, JWT, and the Stripe API.

## About

Sweet Spot is a marketplace for pastry chefs and small bakeries and restaurants to share their baked goods with their community. It was made to bring communities together and to highlight smaller businesses.

This was my final project at Flatiron School and is a combination of Rails, React, Redux, Thunk, JWT, and the Stripe API. 


### How it works

This application was built using React.js and Redux for this frontend portion. Please see the below sections on how to run the application on your local environment.
Please ensure that you have downloaded the [backend portion](https://github.com/mwong068/sweet-spot-back-end) of this application, to ensure full functionality of the application as it was designed.


## Features

- User interface made using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- Single page application is made possible using [React Routers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router)
- Centralized state using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- React styling framework courtesy of [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
